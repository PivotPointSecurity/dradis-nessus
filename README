NessusUpload
================

The Nessus upload plugin will enable user to upload Nessus output files in the
nessus client format (.nessus) to create a structure of nodes/notes that contain
the same information about the hosts/ports/services as the original file.

The parser only supports version 2 of nessus xml format. 
Other formats (nbe, nsr) are not supported at the moment.

Also, the xml parser only extracts the results of a scan. It is not able
to parse the scan policy itself which is also part of the xml file.
